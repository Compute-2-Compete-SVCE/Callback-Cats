Final Report
OBJECTIVE : 
The Objective of the Recipe app is to help the user to manage recipes in a way that will make them easy to follow. You might not have realized this, but recipes are nothing more than culinary algorithms. Like programs , recipes are series of imperative steps which , if followed correctly , result in a tasty dish.


COMPONENTS USED:
 
•	Home
•	Recipe
•	Authentication
Under Recipe Component
 
•	Recipe Detail
•	Recipe Edit
•	Recipe List
•	Recipe Start
Under Recipe List
 
•	Recipe item
Authentication is the most required one for the software we build . So as the same , Recipe software also has feature of authentication of formal user.
 
Validation is much needed one , So the user can only access the Recipe component if they are logged in.
 
For some Demo purpose , we added users to access the recipe page.
 

Once user properly Authenticated  , List of Recipes will be displayed on the left side of the screen. These recipes are listed using card mode , hence if any one of the recipe is clicked , it details will be listed on the other side of the screen.
 
Second one is , we added the “New Recipe” functionality , which enables authenticated user to add recipes to the list.
 
The next thing is , in order to mange the recipe , we included edit  and delete  option to edit or delete the recipe , which are listed .
 

So, once the user clicks the edit option , the below view will be screened. User can edit the recipes if there is any correction in it.
 
Final one is Database section . This Database functionality is completely opened only for the admins. In top right corner  ,  we added a Manage functionality , which actually holds two major CRUD operation .One is to save data and other is to retrieve data, where the saving and fetching of the data has been done using Real time Firebase Database.
 
 

Difficult part in our software is ,we need to toggle the function based on the user inputs , for example same form should be displayed differently based on the user input , if user clicks the edit option ,the credentials should be properly placed in the input fields , where as when “New Recipe ” option , the same form should be displayed with empty credentials.
And we also planned to add two more functionality they are 
•	Search option , to search through the list.
•	Display Relevant Recipes based on user search.
We actually completed the basic functionality of our software , the above options are only for bonus points .
